Question one threw me, though, because it said that my consciousness transferred in the moment of death, which doesn't make sense. As we see in the case of some identical twins, there may be some overlap in consciousness, on a subtle level, owing maybe to aspects of the universe we haven't disentangled yet, but I can't imagine there's a mechanism for having consciousness transport between bodies. Distinct consciousness seems to be contained in one container due to numerous factors, probably relating to fundamental physics.","comp_original_you":3,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":41,"sex":1,"language":1,"edu_science":4,"edu_phil":4,"comments":"I'm convinced that there are subatomic particles that confer consciousness on perceiving machines.
