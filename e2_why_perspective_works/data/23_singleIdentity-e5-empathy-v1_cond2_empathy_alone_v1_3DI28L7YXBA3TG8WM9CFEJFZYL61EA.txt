When waking up, you still had the same brain, memories. It felt weird having a new body, the consciousness is still the same. Thus, original you and clone you is well, you. I believe your brain is was makes you who you are.  I felt different when I woke up because for the first time I was in a perfect body, possibly healthier and less achy than I have been in forever. I think it would be immoral to classify anyone, especially a human as below any other group. Having to pay more taxes simply because you were born in a lab. You did choose that. How you come into this world doesn't make you less or more of human.","comp_original_you":2,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":30,"sex":2,"language":1,"edu_science":7,"edu_phil":6,"comments":"it was interesting.
