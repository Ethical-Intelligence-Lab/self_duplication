Therefore, the clone was now \"me.\" Since the clone was \"me\" that means the clone is now just as much a person as \"I\" was in the original body. Thus, treating the clone any different or less human than the original body was treated would be wrong, since it's still \"me\" and therefore still very human.","comp_original_you":2,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":23,"sex":2,"language":1,"edu_science":9,"edu_phil":6,"comments":"I had no technical difficulties.
