The new body hasn't been field tested, as it were. It might have the same scars and everything, but it hasn't LIVED life to get those scars. But I guess it would be like the famous painting thought experiment... if the Mona Lisa that we all know and love turns out to be a fake and not by da Vinci, doesn't it still hold the value we've placed on it over the years? As for the government taxing a copy higher.... the government can stay out of as much of personal life as possible, the only exception is stopping harm to others/environment. They don't need to know if I even AM a copy let alone tax me more for it. And the method of becoming a copy means the original being is dead, so its not like there will be a ton of extra TurkerA36UL04HDP2QHL's running around.
