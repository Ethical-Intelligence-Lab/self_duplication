Given how I sometimes experience my father, it was a potentially loaded question. Although he has many wonderful qualities and we are close, it certainly is the case that I (and several others) occasionally experience him as being overly judgmental. In asking me the question, it was clear that he wanted to make the point that everyone makes judgments all the time. And, if that is the case, why are only certain people accused of being judgmental? Or, to put it slightly differently, is it fair to say that I am being judgmental if I accuse my father of being judgmental?","comp_original_you":1,"comp_number_copies":3,"age":35,"sex":2,"language":1,"edu_science":8,"edu_phil":9,"comments":"very good.","displayTime":130.662}]}
