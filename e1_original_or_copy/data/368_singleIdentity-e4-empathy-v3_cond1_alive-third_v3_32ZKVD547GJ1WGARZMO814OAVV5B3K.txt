Even though it is identical in every aspect, it is still a replica. It would be like calling an art forger's work authentic. We know it's not by the same hand or by the original artist, no matter how identical it is. The tax situation is wrong because it is not the beings fault that it was created and a copy. That is the mistake of the creators. They are the ones who should bear any financial consequence. It is a being that should not be denied its basic rights because someone copied it in a lab.","comp_original_you":1,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":36,"sex":2,"language":1,"edu_science":5,"edu_phil":4,"comments":"This was a fun philosophical study.
