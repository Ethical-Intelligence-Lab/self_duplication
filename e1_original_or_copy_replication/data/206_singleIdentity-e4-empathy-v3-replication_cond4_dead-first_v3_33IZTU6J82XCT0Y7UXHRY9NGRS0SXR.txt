What about all the memories, personality characteristics, etc - are those able to be copied alongside the actual physical brain? And even if they could, it still would not be totally the same in my eyes; every human person is unique and can't be fully copied/cloned, etc. (and this then not even taking into consideration the belief - which I hold - of a human soul/spirit which can never be duplicated). I also chose that the tax is somewhat fair since it would be different than other 'normal' people, so to be able to then live on in a different (but same/copy) body, I don't see a real problem with a higher tax being asked.","comp_original_you":2,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":35,"sex":1,"language":1,"edu_science":6,"edu_phil":1,"comments":"Yes, this was fun... the idea is certainly an interesting one to think about, especially in the days we live with AI and other technologies being developed.
