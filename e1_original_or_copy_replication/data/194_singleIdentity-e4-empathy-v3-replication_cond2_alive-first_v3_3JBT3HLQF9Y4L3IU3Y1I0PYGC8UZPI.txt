My consciousness, if I am understanding correctly, exists now in both bodies.  We will diverge from here, as we will have different temporal experiences - we can't both be in exactly the same place at the same time - we will move in different directions and see slightly differently from the first, because of division.  Everything each of me does from this moment on will be separate,, and my subsequent lives will be separate and different.  Two separate but equal entities rom then on, with different thoughts and lives.  The tax thing I agreed wo, simply to differentiate from a laboratory created being and  a naturally created one.  I am grappling with the state of the soul , and have no answer for this - 2 different souls now?  Only God can give a soul.
