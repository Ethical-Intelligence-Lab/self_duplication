This is because they are not seeking specific information that can be relayed easily; they are looking at a snapshot of your problem solving process- both to evaluate the process and to find out what its outcomes tend to be. This gives the interviewer insight into how people are likely to function on the job- but it also means that the interviewee needs a little more preparation to be successful.\n\n","comp_original_you":2,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":28,"sex":1,"language":1,"edu_science":8,"edu_phil":9,"comments":"good and nice to do this survey","displayTime":56.482}]}
