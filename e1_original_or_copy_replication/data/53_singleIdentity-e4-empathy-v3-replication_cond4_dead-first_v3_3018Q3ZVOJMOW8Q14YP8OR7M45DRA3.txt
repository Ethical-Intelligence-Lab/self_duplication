Here is my opinion.\n\nBoth are you, the original you is more so you though, the only difference is that it is missing what ever memories the science didn't put into it. such as, perhaps any experience of walking to that office (lab?) that they didn't include, any experience of looking at your clone that they didn't add (they must have added simulated memory to they \"exact copy\", but it is entirely doubtful that is it absolutely 100% the exact same experience that the original you just went through)\n\nLiterally, I record my self every single day, 24/7, with a camera at my computer or mounted on my helmet when I bike ride... I try to get as much data as I possibly can so that I can be recreated in the future... sounds crazy I'm sure but what ever...\n\nI often think about the fact that my body won't be carried into that future unless I do cryonics, which, I hope I can get enough money for someday....  otherwise, yes, It won't be the actual original me, which, I do have a slight problem with, but honestly, at the same time, I have absolutely no problem with at all.\n\nBecause I know that my mind is just a program, a neuronal based program, and it makes no difference if it shuts down given that it can be replicated again with the data I give it now, in the future... I just still somehow feel uncomfortable about it.\n\nSorry for the rant idk if you even want this information.","comp_original_you":2,"comp_number_copies":2,"age":30,"sex":1,"language":1,"edu_science":9,"edu_phil":9,"comments":"Uhh, I am obsessed with the coming technological singularity, if you've got any AI training work that needs to be done, I'll do my best, so please give me qualifications.
