The intrinsic value and the origin of a person cannot be artificially manufactured in a scientific lab, no matter how perfect the process is or how perfect the result is.  Thus, this carries over into taxes as well.  If, for whatever reason, the government decides to legalize this process, then these \"clones\" should not be deemed to have all the same rights as a natural human.  Therefore, the tax rates should be imposed higher than normal as well.  Cloning humans creates and exacerbates the over-population problem and so a penalty should be carried on these individuals.
