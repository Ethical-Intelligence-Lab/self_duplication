I wonder if this will ever be true. I did my best, but the scenario was a bit complicated. I would love to do more of these in the future. Also, I think everyone deserves equal treatment in society and in the world. I wouldn't degrade or over tax anyone just because of how they were born. Thank you for allowing me to participate.
